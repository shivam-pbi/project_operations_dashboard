# 📊 Project Operations Dashboard – Power BI / SQL

This Power BI dashboard was developed to provide real-time insights into project financials and operational performance across infrastructure projects.

---

## 🔍 Purpose

The dashboard was designed for project managers, senior executives, and finance teams to:

- Track budget vs actuals for multiple projects
- Analyze profit margins and cost forecasts
- Monitor project progress based on current phase and timelines
- Enable data-driven decisions with centralized reporting

---

## 🎯 Business Impact

- 🕒 Saved 5–7 hours per week previously spent on manual Excel reporting
- 🚧 Early identification of profit-risk projects via forecast variance
- 📈 Enhanced visibility into cost code performance and inefficiencies
- 👷 Improved crew and resource planning based on productivity analytics

---

## 🛠️ How It Was Built

**Data Sources**:
- Excel exports and SQL-based project/finance data

**Power BI Components**:
- DAX for calculations (forecasted profit, actuals variance, etc.)
- Slicers for filtering by project status, manager, cost codes, and date
- Interactive visuals including bar charts, line charts, and cards

**Dashboard Pages**:
1. **Project Overview** – KPIs, budget vs actuals, revenue vs EAC, forecasted profit
2. **Cost Code Summary** – Cost class breakdown, top/bottom variances
3. **Productivity Report** – Actual vs budgeted labor hours, quantities, and crew days

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- Projects with over ±30% forecast variance were flagged early for action
- Cost codes like "Backfill Pothole <48in" showed high labor inefficiency
- Forecast vs budget gaps informed strategic reallocation of resources
- Scalable dashboard design made it easy to replicate across other divisions
